    <h2>Here are some advanced terminology and topics that will help in the understanding of the vast crypto world:</h2>

    <h3>Decentralized Finance</h3>
    <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a system where financial products and services are built on blockchain networks, making them accessible to anyone with<br>
    an internet connection and eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries like banks. Key concepts include decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, <br> 
    and protocols that enable activities such as lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interestâ€”all in a transparent and often permissionless manner. </p>

    <h3>Staking and Yield Farming</h3>
    <p>Staking: Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support a blockchain network's operations and earn rewards. It helps secure the network and validate transactions,<br>
    typically rewarding participants with additional tokens.</p>

    <p>Yield Farming: Yield farming is a way to earn rewards with cryptocurrency holdings by providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Users can earn interest,<br>
    fees, or governance tokens by lending or staking their assets on these platforms. It often involves moving assets between different protocols to maximize returns.</p>

    <h3> ICO/IEO Investments</h3>
    <p>ICO (Initial Coin Offering): An ICO is a fundraising method where new cryptocurrency projects sell their tokens to early investors in exchange for funding.<br>
    Investors hope the tokens will appreciate in value once the project launches.</p>

    <p>IEO (Initial Exchange Offering): An IEO is similar to an ICO, but the token sale is conducted on a cryptocurrency exchange platform. The exchange typically vets<br>
    the project, manages the token sale, and lists the tokens for trading post-sale, providing a level of security and convenience for investors. </p>
